Welcome to QDMR!
QDMR (Quantitative Differentially Methylated Regions) is a quantitative approach to quantify methylation difference and identify DMRs from genome-wide methylation profiles by adapting Shannon entropy. The platform-free and species-free nature of QDMR makes it potentially applicable to various methylation data. This approach provides an effective tool for the high-throughput identification of the functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation.
The current version of QDMR provide users three both online platform and standalone software for methylation data. And the command line version of QDMR is also launched recently to facilitate the analysis of massive methylation data.
QDMR works from the imported methylation data across a number of samples. It performs all of the steps in following the workflow in Tutorial, including Import Data, Quantify Difference, Identify DMRs, Measure Specificity and Export All Results. Its graphical tools also allow the user to manually inspect the raw methylation levels across samples any time.
